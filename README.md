Dear DS professors,

Unfortunately, after I zipped my data, itâ€™s still too big to be uploaded to Github.

Please see the link to the data that I used here(BRFSS 2021 data):[
](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html) 
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. The survey collects data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services among adults aged 18 years and older.
